Memory games basics
In the memory game, numbers are randomly placed face-down in a grid. Each turn, the player chooses
a number to peek at, and then replace, face down. If they choose two of the same number in a row,
those numbers are removed from the grid. The aim is to clear the board!

Your job is to produce an array of pairs of numbers, placed in a random spot in the array.

The array (and result) could look somthing like:

[3,1,2,1,3,2,4,4]
for an 8 tile memory game. (4 pairs). createTiles(8)

Your task is to implement the function createTiles(n) where n is the number of tiles.
The function should return an array with the length n containing randomized, paired,
integers starting with 1. Duplicate pairs are not allowed.

Special cases:

if n is odd or zero, an empty array should be returned
 */

function createTiles(n){
  if (n%2!==0) return []
  let arr = []
  for (let i=1;i<=n/2;i++){
    arr.push(i)
    arr.push(i)
  }
  return arr.slice(0,1).concat(arr.slice(1).sort((a,b)=>Math.round(Math.random())))
}
